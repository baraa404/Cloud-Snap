> **Upload anything. Get a CDN URL. In seconds.**

Drop an image or video → it hits your GitHub repo → jsDelivr serves it from 100+ edge nodes worldwide. **The URL works forever.** Even if the file gets deleted.

## What it does in 10 seconds

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "file=@screenshot.png" \
  -F "github_token=ghp_xxxx" \
  -F "github_owner=baraa404" \
  -F "github_repo=my-cdn" \
  https://your-cloudsnap.pages.dev/api/public-upload
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "urls": {
    "jsdelivr_commit": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/baraa404/my-cdn@a3f9c12/uploads/screenshot.png",
    "raw_commit":      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baraa404/my-cdn/a3f9c12/uploads/screenshot.png",
    "github_commit":   "https://github.com/baraa404/my-cdn/blob/a3f9c12/uploads/screenshot.png"
  }
}
```

That `jsdelivr_commit` URL? It's **permanent**. Commit-pinned. Globally cached. Works in `<img>` tags, markdown, anywhere.

## Why bother?

| Problem | CloudSnap's answer |
|---|---|
| Imgur deletes old images | GitHub repo = your storage, forever |
| CDNs cost money | jsDelivr is free and blazing fast |
| S3 / Cloudinary setup is painful | This takes 5 minutes |
| Imgur/Cloudinary own your data | You own the GitHub repo |
| No API for automation | Full REST API with cURL/JS/Python examples |

---

## What you get

```
One upload → 6 URL formats automatically:

cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/...@commit/file  ← ⭐ use this (permanent + CDN)
cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/...@main/file    ← CDN but dynamic (branch-based)
raw.githubusercontent.com/.../commit/file  ← raw, permanent
raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/file    ← raw, dynamic
github.com/.../blob/commit/file      ← GitHub page, permanent
github.com/.../blob/main/file        ← GitHub page, dynamic
```
